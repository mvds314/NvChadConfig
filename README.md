# NvChadConfig

My config for [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/).

Clone this repo into:

- C:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/nvim/, on Windows,
- ~/.config/nvim/ folder, on Linux.

This branch is essentially a fork of NvChad, i.e., changes made to the main NvChad branch are merged regularly.

The config is optimized for:

- Scientific programming with Python
- Writing documents in LaTeX
- Edit Neovim lua config files
- Edititing: json, yaml, bash, markdown, lua, docker ...

The config is largely based on [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BnVeOUeZxc), and has migrated to breaking changes as introduced in [NvChad 2.5](https://nvchad.com/news/v2.5_release/).
