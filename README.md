# NvChadConfig

My config for [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/).

After installing NvChad, clone this repo into:

- C:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/nvim/lua/custom/, on Windows,
- ~/.config/nvim/lua/custom/ folder, on Linux.

The config is optimized for:

- Scientific programming with Python
- Writing documents in LaTeX
- Edit Neovim lua config files
- Edititing: json, yaml,...

The config is largely based on [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BnVeOUeZxc).
